## Our expectations

We are expecting code that:

 * Is correct and that we can reasonable verify is correct.
 * Can be understood easily by the entire team.
 * Uses resources (network, disk, CPU and memory) sparingly.
 * Thought put into how the solution will scale, ideally horizontally.

## How much time are you expecting us to spend on this?

We don't necessarily want you to complete the whole task, but we do want you to show us something that justifies us moving you to the next stage of the interview process. It is perfectly acceptable for you to narrow the task down as we are looking for quality rather than quantity.

You can also assume that we'll be looking in detail at what you've produced and will likely be asking questions about your response in the next stage of the interview process.

When addressing, our advice is to remember that this is primarily set up as a thinking exercise rather that just a coding exercise.  We are not expecting vast amounts of code, rather we are interested in how you think, how you structure your thinking and communicate it with us.

## What language should I use?

You can use any language you feel is appropriate.

## The Task

Your program should run on the command line and take one argument which is a filename that contains a large list of words separated by new lines. For example `this_is_my_program this_is_my_data_file.txt`.

This file should be re-organized so that the words that are anagrams of each other are all on one line separated by spaces.

### Example Input

```input
apple
car
cider
tar
itch
rat
cried
helicopter
arc
```

### Example Output

```output
apple
car arc
cider cried
tar rat
itch
helicopter
```


## Assumptions

We assume that the list of words is larger than the memory on the computer that it is ran on. You can make any other assumptions about the file which you wish, but you must state them.

## Good luck!
